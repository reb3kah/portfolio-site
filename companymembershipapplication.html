      <h2>Case Study for Company Membership Application</h2>
      <p>Project: Company Membership Application</p>
      <p>My role: end-to-end UX Design</p>
      <p>Duration: 6 months</p>
      <p>Problem statement: New Member Applications submitted by viable candidates to Bluetooth SIG are being disqualified multiple times. This causes: a poor new member experience, increased staff time to assist and hand hold perspective members
        through the process, and brand degradation.</p>
      <p>The challenge: Re-design the new member application with these three end goals in mind:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The application process provides a great first impression to prospective members</li>
        <li>Prospective members can easily complete and submit an application</li>
        <li>Staff (the Membership team) can efficiently, seamlessly, and electronically process new member applications</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Research & Discovery Process</h3>
      <p>This project was unique in that we understood a lot of information about the problem when we started. To kick off, we did some stakeholder interviews with our Membership team, reviewed support tickets we’d received regarding the company membership application, and did a proto-persona workshop. </p>
      <p><b>Stakeholder Interviews</b></p>
      <p>I worked closely with my Product Manager to facilitate a series of interviews with our Membership team. One of our Membership team’s primary functions is to review company membership applications as they come in, and they were able to give me really insightful information on the pain points end users were experiencing in the current application process. I learned that 80% of applications received were disqualified, and most were disqualified do to very solvable reasons such as the applicant not having proper signing authority, or the company information given was somehow incorrect (most common errors were they misunderstood the requirement for entering their “Company Legal Name,” and the formation document they uploaded was incorrect or not a certified copy. Another common reason for disqualification was being unable to confirm the applicant’s email domain.)</p>
      <p><b>Review of Support Tickets</b></p>
      <p>I also worked with my Product Manager to review all of the support tickets users had sent in to Bluetooth SIG regarding the company membership application. What we found was that 57% of all support tickets our Membership team received were around the company membership application (35% were users asking what their application status was, 17% were users saying they needed their verification email re-sent, and the additional 6% fell under other application categories in the 0.3-2.5% range).</p>
      <p><b>Proto-Persona Workshop</b></p>
      <p>Once I felt like I had a really good grasp on the problems our users were facing in the current design of the company membership application, I put together a workshop to establish some proto-personas. At the end, we had four proto-personas that were used to help guide the re-design of the company membership application.</p>
      <p><b>Findings</b></p>
      <p>At this point I had a good knowledge of who my users were, their needs, irritations, and points of confusion. I also knew from our Membership team which parts of the application were outdated and needed to be removed or changed in some way. With this knowledge, I quickly got to work on the design process.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Design Process</h3>
      <p>Early designs were created in Balsalmiq and went through a few iterations based on feedback after reviews with the Membership team. Once I felt confident about the information architecture and overall user flow, I re-created them as a high-fidelity clickable prototype using Adobe XD.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at what some of the low-fidelity wireframes created in Balsamiq looked like:</p>

      <br>
      <p>Here are a few of the more “major” improvements that the re-design addresses.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Testing & Iteration</h3>
      <p>I conducted a series of usability tests on a clickable prototype of the redesigned application. Due to covid, all of the usability test sessions were hosted remotely. Overall, the feedback from end users was very positive. Users really loved the way the application was broken down into manageable pieces (some referred to it as “TurboTax style” – implying that we were able to design a form with complicated components in a way that was straightforward and not frustrating).</p>
      <p>We also received feedback on some ways to further improve. Here are some of the notable updates we made based on the negative feedback from usability tests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Added some turn around time on confirmation page after the application was submitted.</b> Users expressed the desire to understand what the turn-around time would be for their application to be reviewed. We added a statement stating the turn-around time to the submission confirmation page.</li>
        <li><b>Make it more clear that the application saves automatically.</b> Some users didn’t realize during testing that the application was savable, so I added a lot more text reminders on several screens throughout the application.</li>
        <li><b>Remove the BIN field.</b> All testers stated that they either 1) didn’t know what “BIN” – Business Identification Number - referred to, or 2) they assumed it was their tax ID number (which it isn’t). I brought these results back to the Membership team, who were able to compromise and agreed to not include BIN as a requirement for the re-design. Including it was not worth the added confusion to the end user, as the Membership rarely, if ever uses this information anyway.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>We also later conducted real-world testing through a slow release of the application. Once the app was fully built we funneled a small amount of real applicants through it. The redesign was fully released to all applicants 2.5 months later.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, we were able to fully re-design the new member application in a way that gave prospective members a really good first impression of Bluetooth SIG, and successfully allowed the Membership team to smoothly process applications while taking up less of their time.</p>
      <p>This application was just fully released to production on 11/30/2021. I will update this section over the next couple months with updated metrics.</p>
